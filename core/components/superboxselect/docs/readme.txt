SuperBoxSelect is a TV for MODx Revolution 2.2 inspired by SuperBoxSelect ExtJS Plugin (http://www.technomedia.co.uk/SuperBoxSelect/examplesRemote.html).

This TV displays selected resources as labelled boxes within the form field. As seen on facebook, hotmail and other sites, it combines both auto-complete and multi-selection capabilities.
